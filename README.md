The AI Mood Journal App is a personalized emotional wellness companion designed to help users understand and track their feelings through intelligent journaling. It allows users to write daily reflections, while built-in AI analyzes each entry to detect emotions, generate mood scores, and offer insights into patterns over time. A visual calendar provides a quick snapshot of daily moods through color-coded indicators, and an analytics dashboard transforms journal data into meaningful graphs, trend reports, and emotion summaries. Users can customize the experience with themes, fonts, and emoji mood sets while enjoying optional wellness tools such as breathing exercises, affirmations, and meditation guides. Smart reminders encourage consistent journaling, and advanced privacy features—including Face ID, Touch ID, and encrypted local storage—ensure emotional data stays secure. With options to export entries, back up to the cloud, and even earn streaks or achievements through gamification, the app offers a complete, user-friendly ecosystem for building emotional awareness and improving mental well-being.
